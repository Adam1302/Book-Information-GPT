    Here is an example of fiction books about the ultimate futility of life:
    1. "The Stranger" by Albert Camus:
    Camus' novel follows the detached Meursault as he grapples with the absurdity of existence, portraying the ultimate futility of conventional societal expectations.
    2. "Nausea" by Jean-Paul Sartre:
    In this existentialist classic, Roquentin's contemplation of existence in a small town becomes a profound exploration of the inherent nausea and meaninglessness of life.
    3. "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy:
    McCarthy's post-apocalyptic tale follows a father and son as they traverse a desolate world, reflecting on the futility of survival and the relentless march toward an uncertain future.

    Here is another example of paintings about the illusion of love:
    1: "The Lovers II" by Ren√© Magritte:
    Magritte's surrealist painting challenges the conventional notion of love by depicting two lovers with their heads veiled, questioning the authenticity and reality of the emotions involved.
    2: "Automat" by Edward Hopper:
    Hopper's iconic painting captures a woman alone in a restaurant, suggesting the isolation that can accompany the illusion of love and the complexities of human connection.
    3: "The Kiss" by Gustav Klimt:
    Klimt's masterpiece, featuring a couple locked in an intimate embrace surrounded by ornate patterns, explores the intertwining of love and the decorative, raising questions about the substance behind the illusion of passion.
    4: "The Birth of Venus" by Sandro Botticelli:
    Botticelli's iconic painting of Venus emerging from the sea symbolizes the idealized and mythological aspects of love, inviting contemplation on the illusionary nature of beauty and desire.
